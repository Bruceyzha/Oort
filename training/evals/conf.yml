# ip address of the parameter server (need 1 GPU)
ps_ip: 10.0.0.4

# ip address of each worker:# of gpus on this worker
# Note that if we collocate ps and worker, then we need to decrease this number of gpus by 1
# E.g., master node has 4 GPUs, then 1 for the ps, and worker should be set to: worker:3
